This project is a machine learning and deep learning-based web application built with Streamlit that detects and classifies brain tumors from MRI images.
The system helps in early diagnosis by automatically analyzing MRI scans and categorizing them into specific tumor types.

Features

Upload an MRI scan image.

Automatic preprocessing and prediction.

Classifies the image into one of the following categories:

Glioma

Meningioma 

Pituitary Tumor 

No Tumor 

Provides a simple, interactive web interface.


Python (Deep Learning & Preprocessing)

TensorFlow  (Model Training)

Streamlit (Web Application)

NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib (Image Processing & Visualization)
